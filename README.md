# GraphicsCameraLight
OpenGL/C++/GLSL project - a model of a 3D scene + camera (with its movement around the scene controlled by keyboard input). Implements textures and Phong ligthing model with Phong shading.

## How to run
Firstly, move the shader.vert and shader.frag files into dir Shaders in the main folder. Secondly, move the graphics to the dir Textures. Add a GLM library to the dir glm (not included in the repo). Then either compile the source files by yourself in any OS or run KameraSwiatlo executable in Linux (optimally Debian-related distro).
